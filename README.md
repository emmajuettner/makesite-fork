Emma's fork of makesite.py
==========================

This is a fork of [Sunaina Pai](https://github.com/sunainapai)'s
[makesite static site generator](https://github.com/sunainapai/makesite),
customized to generate my personal website.

Running the site locally
------------------------

To run the site on Windows, run 'sh' in a command prompt in the main
project directory, then run ./makesite.sh. This will build and serve
the current version of the site at http://localhost:8000/.

The `_site` directory contains the generated static site files.
