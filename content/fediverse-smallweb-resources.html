<h1>Fediverse & Smallweb Resources</h1>

<p>This is a list of helpful tools and resources related to the fediverse and the indieweb/smallweb/etc.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://mastogizmos.com/">MastoGizmos</a> is a collection of tools
	for exploring Mastodon posts and users. Some of the most useful ones I've used
	are the <a href="https://mastogizmos.com/gag.html">Gift Article Gazette</a> 
	(which aggregates gift article links posted to some of the larger Mastodon instances) 
	and the <a href="https://mastogizmos.com/bmhs.html">Big Hashtag Search</a> 
	(which allows you to see posts with a given hashtag from a variety of Masto instances), 
	but there are lots of other tools there as well.</li>
	<li><a href="https://rss-is-dead.lol/">RSS Is Dead LOL</a> is a website where 
	you can enter your fediverse handle and find RSS feeds from the profiles of the people
	you follow. May have some quirks depending on your fedi software, e.g. my fedi
	server only displays my 20 most recent follows publically so I only see my 
	20 most recent follows on this site. Probably works better for Mastodon users.</li>
</ul>
