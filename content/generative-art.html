<!-- title: Generative Art -->
<h1>Generative Art</h1>

<p>Okay, I haven't yet taken the time to figure out how I can embed any of my generative art in this website,
so for now I'm just going to link to my <a href="https://openprocessing.org/user/172946/">OpenProcessing page</a>.
I mostly use Processing/p5js for making generative art, and most of my sketches are posted on OpenProcessing.
These days, I'm particularly interested in making animated art that responds to music as an input.
Fun fact: the background images on this site were all generated using p5js code!</p>
