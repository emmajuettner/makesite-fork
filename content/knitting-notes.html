<h1>Knitting Notes</h1>
<p>This page is a place to keep useful knitting tutorials and some of my favorite knitting patterns plus notes.
Mainly this is so I can find the information again for myself, but maybe you will find it useful too!</p>
<h2>Patterns</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.knitatude.ca/shop/jog-on-shorts-knitting-pattern">Jog On Shorts</a> by Knitatude.
	These shorts are really comfy and fun to knit; it's mostly endless rows of stockinette in the round,
	good for tv knitting.</li>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Adding pockets:</b> The pattern is sadly pocketless but I knit a patch pocket in stockinette,
			a rectangle with one vertical side slanted inward
			using decreases to make a slanted pocket opening, and sewed it on after finishing the shorts.
			Looks nice and can hold light objects, but seems like it would stretch out if used for heavier items
			like a phone. Planning to make another pair of shorts and try a different pocket strategy,
			maybe like <a href="https://kelbournewoolens.com/blog/2017/04/inserting-a-vertical-pocket/">
			this vertical pocket tutorial</a>, possibly anchoring the pocket to the waistband or using
			a less stretchy stitch pattern like linen stitch for the parts that bear the weight of the
			pocket's contents.</li>
			<li><b>Length alteration:</b> Shorts as written are very short, but it's easy to lengthen them
			by just... continuing to knit once you get to the legs. As a sidenote, i-cord bind-off does a pretty good
			job of preventing the hems from curling.</li>
			<li><b>Trying on shorts:</b> It's difficult to try on these shorts until you reach the leg split
			(at least, if you're using circular needles that have a shorter circumference than your hips),
			which is a bit nerve-wracking, but you can transfer the stitches to a longer length of string temporarily
			to be able to try it on before that point.</li>
