<h1>Collage Poetry</h1>

<h2>Junk Mail Poems</h2>
<p>
Poems composed of (mostly) junk mail.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="/posts/goblin-time">Goblin Time</a>, January 2022. A request for charitable donations in honor of #goblinWeek.</li>
	<li><a href="/posts/youre-invited">You're Invited</a>, January 2022. An invitation to an innovative Secret Santa exchange.</li>
	<li><a href="/posts/alert">Alert</a>, August 2021. An important warning and a sales pitch.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Econ Workbook Poems</h2>
<p>I have an old econ workbook from college, "Study Guide for Economics (Ninth Edition)" by David Colander and Jenifer Gamber. 
It's the type that has practice questions and answers so you can do mock exams as a way to study for the real ones.
I'm (very slowly) working on a collage poetry zine composed entirely
of text from this workbook.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="/posts/the-logic-of-individual-choice">The Logic of Individual Choice</a>, January 2023. A poem about planting seeds.</li>
	<li><a href="/posts/a-bad-dream">A Bad Dream</a>, May 2022. In which you are interrogated by the first-year members of Congress.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Visual Collages</h2>
<p>Collages that have more visual imagery as well as text.
These are from when I first really got into collage poetry,
at craft nights with some friends and a very big bin of papers and magazines.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="/posts/bears-have-adjectives">Bears have adjectives</a>, February 2020. An important PSA about bears.</li>
	<li><a href="/posts/what-makes-you-feel-better">What makes you feel better</a>, January 2020. A non-linear, non-comprehensive list of Good Things.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>This poem doesn't really fit into any of the other categories, but it's one of my favorites.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="/posts/vi-a-counterexample">VI. A counterexample</a>, February 2020. Basically sci-fi flash fiction masquerading as a logical proof.</li>
</ul>
