<h2>The Logic of Individual Choice</h2>
<p>
Suppose you are a novice gardener.
</p>
<p>
The television reports<br/>
pictures of melting ice and flooded areas.<br/>
Warm weather arrives and<br/>
Southern California experiences unusually<br/>
high temperatures.<br/>
A small city located by a lake has been<br/>
dumping its raw sewage into the lake.
</p>
<p>
You<br/>
plant one seed in a flower pot and watch it grow.
</p>
<p>
Your friend says, "Why<br/>
are you wasting your time? You can't provide<br/>
the world's supply of wheat berries in your<br/>
little pot."
</p>
<p>
You cannot produce 100 tons of wheat per day.<br/>
However, you do produce<br/>
a stalk of wheat with plump wheat berries.
</p>
<p>
If the weather gets very hot, what will most<br/>
likely happen?<br/>
In the long run, what will happen?
</p>
<p>
The next year, you plant two seeds in that pot.
