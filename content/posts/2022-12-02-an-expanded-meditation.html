<!-- title: An Expanded Meditation -->
<!-- summary: NaNoGenMo 2022 entry. A novel composed of dubious whale definitions, with apologies to Herman Melville. -->
<p>
If you are not familiar with <a href="https://nanogenmo.github.io/">NaNoGenMo</a>: it is an annual challenge to write some code that generates a novel (at least 50,000 words) within the month of November. This was my first year participating! In fact, I nearly
did not participate this year either... I started this entry on a whim at 6:30pm on November 30th. ðŸ˜Š
</p>
<p>
There were a lot of other cool entries this year, which I'd encourage you to check out! If you were drawn to this post by the Melville
mention, it may interest you to know that there were not one, but two other Moby Dick themed submissions! One of them takes the novel 
and <a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2022/issues/46">blacks out every repetition of a word</a>, and the other
<a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2022/issues/34">colorizes words</a> in the book.
</p>
<p>
A few more of the other submissions that I thought were especially interesting, in no particular order: 
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2022/issues/9">An Unfinished Novel of 50015 Words</a>, a self-referential
	novel that I found genuinely funny.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2022/issues/28">A Letter Groove</a>, a program that "cuts out" words
	in scanned book pages to reveal what's beneath (some of the output is really quite beautiful).</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2022/issues/35">There Are Stars</a>, an interactive story where starring the Github
	repository causes a new character to be added to the story. Technically not a complete entry because it didn't reach 50,000
	words by the end of November, but I think it's one of the most impressive and creative ones I've seen.
	<li><a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2022/issues/42">Broken Computer Games</a>, a compilation book of BASIC programs
	that are composed of mashed-up lines from the book Basic Computer Games by Dave Ahl.</li>
</ul>
</p>

The premise of my submission: In Moby Dick, Ishmael defines a whale as "a spouting fish with a horizontal tail."
My generated novel consists of a series of other dubiously accurate whale definitions in the same format, constructed using a
<a href="https://github.com/emmajuettner/an-expanded-meditation/blob/main/tracery-grammar.json">tracery grammar</a>.
To put together a grammar that had enough word variety to make the output interesting, I pulled from a
<a href="https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/humans/descriptions.json">list of adjectives</a> from Darius Kazemi's corpora repo, as well as many of the "words used to describe" lists published by Macmillan Dictionary.
The below excerpt is the beginning of the example output I generated; you can read the
<a href="https://github.com/emmajuettner/an-expanded-meditation/blob/main/output.txt">full output</a>
as well, if you're really that interested in whale definitions.

<h2>An Expanded Meditation</h2>
<p>'Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail. There you have him. However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded meditation.'
