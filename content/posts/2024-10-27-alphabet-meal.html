<!-- title: Alphabet Meal -->
<!-- summary: A recipe for a meal containing one ingredient for each letter of the alphabet, inspired by Taskmaster. -->
<p>
If you, like me, are a fan of the show Taskmaster, you might remember the series 1 task
where contestants are challenged to cook a meal containing an ingredient for each
letter of the alphabet. If it doesn't ring a bell, the episode ("The Last Supper", the series finale!) is 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bfm6wtG3Zgk">available to watch on YouTube</a>.
</p>
<p>
The original task:
</p>
<blockquote>
Make the best meal for the Taskmaster using ingredients beginning with every letter
of the alphabet. You have a total of two hours. Your time starts now.
</blockquote>
<p>
Half the fun of Taskmaster is thinking about how you would approach the challenges,
so naturally, I watched this challenge and immediately went, "Oooh, I want to give this a try!"
However, I did also want to make a meal that would actually taste good, so I did not
restrict the amount of time I had to plan and prepare the meal. Also, there's some ambiguity
in the wording of the task about whether you can use more than one ingredient starting
with the same letter of the alphabet, but I chose to interpret it in the strict sense of
one ingredient per letter.
</p>
<p>
My approach was to tackle the difficult letters first; for example, there's not a ton
of ingredients starting with k, q, or x, so I decided that my meal would include
kiwi, quick oats, and xanthan gum, and then filled in the easier ingredients from there.
Here's my final list of ingredients:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Apple juice</li>
	<li>Banana</li>
	<li>Coconut milk</li>
	<li>Dark chocolate chunks</li>
	<li>Egg</li>
	<li>Flour</li>
	<li>Gochujang</li>
	<li>Honey</li>
	<li>Italian seasonings</li>
	<li>Jasmine rice</li>
	<li>Kiwi</li>
	<li>Lemon juice</li>
	<li>Mushrooms</li>
	<li>Nutmeg</li>
	<li>Olive oil</li>
	<li>Pesto</li>
	<li>Quick oats</li>
	<li>Raspberries</li>
	<li>Salt</li>
	<li>Tofu</li>
	<li>Unsalted butter</li>
	<li>Vinegar</li>
	<li>Water chestnuts</li>
	<li>Xanthan gum</li>
	<li>Yeast</li>
	<li>Zest of a lemon</li>
</ul>
<p>
The above ingredients can be combined into the following dishes:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fruit salad</li>
	<li>Tofu and vegetables in a spicy sauce over rice</li>
	<li>Bread rolls with a lemon pesto dipping sauce</li>
	<li>Oatmeal chocolate chip banana cookies for dessert</li>
	<li>And apple juice to drink!</li>
</ul>
<p>
Not a bad meal, if I say so myself. It turned out very tasty, for the most part.
The only thing I wouldn't make again was the pesto dipping sauce; it was
a bit much for dipping bread rolls in, though I do enjoy making a somewhat 
similar lemon/pesto/butter sauce to go over pasta. The best element of the meal
was definitely the sauce for the tofu and vegetables. This meal was the first time 
I had made a sauce with these particular ingredients combined, and it was delicious--
definitely worth a full five points! It has since become a regular in my meal rotation.
I do typically use soy sauce as well when cooking tofu, but it's omitted here because
it would have conflicted with my S ingredient, salt.

If for some reason you would like to replicate my alphabet meal, I've included a recipe below.
(As a side note, writing up this blog post has been a fun excursion into learning about

I also highly recommend trying your hand at the alphabet challenge for yourself, it's quite fun!
