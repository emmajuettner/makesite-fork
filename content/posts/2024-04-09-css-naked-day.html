<!-- summary: Stripping the styles off of my website in celebration of semantic markup. -->
<p>
If you're reading this on April 9th directly on my website (rather than via RSS),
this post should be displayed without styles, because it's 
<a href="https://css-naked-day.github.io/">CSS Naked Day</a>! Well, actually, if you have dark mode
enabled or if you've previously selected a theme on my site, you might be seeing those
styles instead (I didn't want to mess with styles if someone had already expressed
a preference, since it might be unpleasant to be expecting dark mode
and get hit with the bright white default background). 
But otherwise, you should be seeing the bare HTML.

I've also added a permanent "plain html mode" button
to the theme picker at the top of my website. I think it's useful to have the option
of seeing my website without markup anytime because it better reflects how some people will
interact with the content (via RSS reader, screen reader, etc.) and it gives people
options for how they want to interact with my site (maybe they use dark mode generally,
but want to try the plain html just to see what the plain markup looks like).
The theme picker does rely on Javascript; I'm not entirely happy with this,
since some people can't or won't use JS, but I don't know
of another way to allow selection of multiple themes (not just light/dark) on
a static site. If you do know of a way to do this, though, let me know!
