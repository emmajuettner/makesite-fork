<!-- summary: A digital collage poem project, composed from random Wikipedia pages. -->

<p>You know that Wikipedia link that takes you to a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">random Wikipedia page</a>? 
I've always found that really neat. It kind of replicates the feeling of 
flipping through a book to see what weird or interesting things you’ll find on 
whichever page you stop at (this works especially well with thick books like 
encyclopedias, dictionaries, or Bibles). A book as a physical object inherently 
has that affordance, but digital media often doesn’t unless someone takes the 
time to build it in. So I always appreciate when people put in that effort to make 
it easier to digitally stumble across cool things that you might otherwise have 
never known existed.</p>

<p>I also enjoy making collage poems out of material that is not typically seen
 as having intrinsic artistic merit (see also: composing poetry from junk mail 
 or econ test questions). So it occurred to me that random Wikipedia pages might 
 make for a really interesting source of collage material.</p>

<p>Since large language model (LLM) tools have been such a constant topic of 
conversation lately, I’ve also been thinking a lot about collage poetry in 
juxtaposition to LLM-generated text. One of the primary (and, in my opinion, 
accurate) criticisms of LLMs is that they vacuum up other people’s words without 
permission, stick them in a computational blender, and claim the output as an 
original creative work; and that one or more aspects of this process is unethical. 
At a glance, collage poetry, whether analog or digital, has some similarities 
to LLM text generation! When I compose a poem, I am taking other people’s words 
(often without asking permission) and mixing them up into something that I would 
consider to be a “new” creative work. Because of these seeming similarities, 
I have been thinking a lot lately about what responsibilities artists have when 
making art that is very directly derived from others’ work.</p>

<p>Without going too far off on this tangent-- one principle that I think is 
important is citation of the original source material. Any collage art is sort of 
intrinsically in conversation with the original work from which it was composed, 
and I think it’s valuable to explicitly name the source material so that anyone 
looking at the derivative work can better understand that conversation. You’re 
missing out on so much context if you only see the collage in isolation. This is why, 
in my Wikipedia collage poems, I have included citation footnotes which link to 
the pages where I originally found each phrase. It’s partly just continuing a 
visual gimmick (the poems are formatted and styled to look like Wikipedia pages), 
but it’s also just a straightforward way to credit the original material. 
And maybe it will make some people curious to explore the cited pages 
(like, does Martha Stewart’s Wikipedia page really contain the word “Gnomes”? 
The answer is yes!).</p>

<p>I have finished a few poems now so I consider it finished-enough to be posted here,
 though I intend to keep making some more poems as I have time. I'm calling the 
 project <a href="https://emmajuettner.com/found-wikipoetry/">Found Wikipoetry</a> 
 (mainly because the names "Wikipoetry" or "Wikipoem" 
 seem to have already been taken). You can read the poems, and some more 
 information about how they were created, at the above link.</p>
