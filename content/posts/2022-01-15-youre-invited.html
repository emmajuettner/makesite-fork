<h2>You're invited.</h2>
<p>
You can join our secret SantaÂ® program.<br/>
This is a free program offered by "Granny"
</p>
<p>
How it works<br/>
Sign up online with your phone number<br/>
in as little as 30 seconds.<br/>
Then upload your biometric info<br/>
and a few selfies
</p>
<p>
You'll get paired with a real, human person<br/>
in the Chicago area.
</p>
<p>
You'll love your new online friend<br/>
So every year around the holidays, you are encouraged to<br/>
shower your friend with presents
</p>
<p>
Can't figure out what to get?<br/>
We give you quick, easy access to<br/>
personal information, financial information, credit report, or health information<br/>
so you can find an age- and gender-appropriate holiday gift.<br/>
The perfect present is something that feels<br/>
eerily personalized
</p>
<p>
Your gift will help someone to have<br/>
a magic surprise this holiday season.<br/>
So, join now!
</p>
<p>
*IMPORTANT! We do not receive funding from Kevin McCallister
