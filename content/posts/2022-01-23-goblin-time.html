<h2>goblin time</h2>
<p>
It's time to talk about goblins.<br/>
You know, a little wild, a little green,<br/>
kind of like Muppets?
</p>
<p>
Well, they need your help.
</p>
<p>
Goblins in our community<br/>
are suffering, exhausted by the internet,<br/>
and want to snuggle in for their holiday hibernation.
</p>
<p>
Your support is crucial in helping<br/>
provide them with year-round access to their daily needs:
<ul>
	<li>Cuppa joe</li>
	<li>weird radish Waffle</li>
	<li>a cedarwood candle</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Please donate today. All gifts are tax deductible to the extent allowed by law.
<ul>
	<li>$15 can help feed and vaccinate a goblin</li>
	<li>$25 can purchase them a cozy flannel nightie</li>
	<li>$50 can help them receive a lot of weird new bugs</li>
</ul>
Any amount helps!
</p>
<p>
Wrap a bit of cash in brown paper<br/>
and place it in ANY garden on a crisp morning...<br/>
we'll find it.
