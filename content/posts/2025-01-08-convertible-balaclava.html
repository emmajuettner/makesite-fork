<!-- summary: Notes on knitting a balaclava that doubles as a hat. -->

Over the holidays, I knit Poppy Shop's 
<a href="https://www.poppyshop.ca/product-page/convertible-knit-balaclava">Convertible Balaclava pattern</a>.
It's a very satisfying quick knit, and it turns out I finished it just in time:
we've had a spell of cold weather (below 20F) this week in Chicago, and my balaclava has been keeping my
face warm on walks and bike rides. I had some apprehension that fogging would be an issue
since I wear glasses, and it does fog somewhat, but when moving briskly a lot of the warm air
seems to blow away before it can condense on my glasses. The balaclava also rolls up into a hat.
I've found that this works best if I position the eye hole towards the back of my head when
wearing it in hat mode. Otherwise, if I wear it rolled up with the eye hole in front, my hair tends to stick
out of it and looks a bit wild.

My balaclava is a little pointier on top than the original pattern; 
this is because I forgot the all-knit rounds in the crown section, so I was decreasing every round 
instead of every other round. I like the pointy look, though, so I'm going to pretend it was a deliberate
style element. I do think the fit would be slightly better if I had followed the pattern as written.

Yarn used: The turquoise on top is Malabrigo Worsted Emerald, and the variegated on the bottom is Malabrigo Rios Virgo.
They are SO SOFT! I am definitely keeping this yarn in mind for future projects.
I had a substantial amount of both leftover after finishing the balaclava.
I knit a water bottle carrier (the 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090530210949/http://mingledyarn.net/downloads/waterweb.pdf">Water Web</a>) using some of the remaining turquoise yarn,
but I still have more leftover!

<p>Also, both skeins I used for this project were acquired from The Dropped Stitch,
which I would highly recommend visiting if you enjoy yarn crafts and are in Chicago.
