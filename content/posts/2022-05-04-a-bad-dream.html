<h2>A Bad Dream</h2>
<p>
You are sitting in a hard chair at a desk with good lighting.<br/>
You have been asked to speak to the first-year<br/>
Congresspeople.<br/>
You tell them that you don't remember<br/>
the presentation material.<br/>
The first-year members of Congress ask you<br/>
"Why Don't More People Wear Velcro Shoes?"<br/>
You realize that you don't have enough information<br/>
to answer the question.<br/>
You tell them<br/>
a humorous quote: "Teaching a parrot the<br/>
phrase supply and demand does not make it an<br/>
economist."<br/>
You are asked to elaborate on your answer.<br/>
You reveal to these first-year members of<br/>
Congress that you believe Shrek II is the glue that holds<br/>
economics together.<br/>
Still another Congressperson asks, "Were you awake during class?"<br/>
You smile and say that you were<br/>
playing the online game Second Life.<br/>
Instead of thanking you immensely for your remarks,<br/>
the first-year members of Congress come running after you.<br/>
Hint: You should run<br/>
