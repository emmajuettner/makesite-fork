<h1>Colophon</h1>
	<p>
	This website was handcrafted with love, and also with a lot of useful tools
	and resources which are listed below. (<a href="https://indieweb.org/colophon">What's a colophon?</a>
	TLDR: info about how I made this site.)
	</p>
<h2>The Basics</h2>
	<p>
	I use a <a href="https://github.com/emmajuettner/makesite-fork">custom fork</a> of
	<a href="https://github.com/sunainapai/makesite">makesite.py</a> as a static site generator, and I host the
	static files on Github. My starting point for creating my HTML & CSS layouts was
	<a href="https://sadgrl.online/projects/layout-builder/">Sadgrl's Layout Builder</a>.
	(I highly recommend that layout builder if you, like me, enjoy styling things with CSS but
	cannot build a decent flex box layout to save your life.)
	</p>
<h2>Privacy</h2>
	<p>
	This website does not gather any analytics or other information about its visitors. If you select a theme from the
	bar at the top, it will save that preference in your browser's local storage, as described below.
	</p>
<h2>Themes</h2>
	<p>
	You can toggle between multiple different CSS themes in the bar at the top of the page. There's 
	<a href="/js/theme.js">a bit of javascript</a> which saves your theme selection in your localStorage,
	so you should consistently see the same theme you've picked.
	If you haven't selected a theme but you have your browser set to prefer dark mode, it'll default to the dark theme.
	Otherwise, light mode is the default.
	I set up this functionality using this <a href="https://timvisee.com/blog/dark-mode-toggle-on-static-website/">
	tutorial on creating a dark mode toggle</a> and this <a href="https://www.codemzy.com/blog/dark-mode-to-static-site">
	tutorial on setting theme based on user dark mode preferences</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	I doubt I will be able to resist adding more themes now that I've got the basic functionality in place, so watch this
	space... by which I mean, the bar at the top of this page. ðŸ˜Š
	</p>
<h2>Typography</h2>
	<p>
	The font I'm using is <a href="http://vollkorn-typeface.com/">Vollkorn</a>, "the free and healthy typeface for bread and butter use."
	</p>
<h2>Images</h2>
	<p>
	I use <a href="https://tinypng.com/">TinyPNG</a> to reduce the file size of my images.
	</p>
<h2>Feeds</h2>
	<p>
	I generate both an RSS and an Atom feed of my posts. I used the 
	<a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/#validate_by_input">W3C Feed Validation Service</a>
	to make sure the generated feeds have valid syntax. To style the feeds so that they're
	more human-readable, I used <a href="https://lepture.com/en/2019/rss-style-with-xsl">
	this tutorial on styling RSS feeds</a> and <a href="https://andrewstiefel.com/style-atom-xsl/">
	this tutorial on styling Atom feeds</a>.
