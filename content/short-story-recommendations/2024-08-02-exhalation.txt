<!-- title: Exhalation -->
<!-- author: Ted Chiang -->
<!-- summary: Actually this is a recommendation not just for the story "Exhalation" but for the entire collection of short stories by the same name. It's a really thought-provoking and cohesive collection that approaches our concepts of time and consciousness and choice from a variety of angles. But "Exhalation" the story is also available to read online if you are in the mood for an unusual sort of apocalypse. -->
