<!-- title: Short Story Recommendations -->
<h1>Short Story Recommendations</h1>
<p>I like short stories, and I like making lists of things.
Lately I've started keeping this (non-comprehensive) list of short stories that I have enjoyed.
The majority are sci-fi, since that's what I read most of.
Latest additions go at the top of the list.</p>

	Excellent story about a haunted ankle.</li>
