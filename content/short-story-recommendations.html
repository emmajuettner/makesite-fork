<!-- title: Short Story Recommendations -->
<h1>Short Story Recommendations</h1>
<p>I like short stories, and I like making lists of things.
Lately I've started keeping this (non-comprehensive) list of short stories that I have enjoyed.
The majority are sci-fi, since that's what I read most of.
Latest additions go at the top of the list.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/pauling_09_22/">Shining Bursa and the Listening Post</a> by Sarah Pauling.
	This story works well on two very different scales; it's in one sense a space epic that spans centuries, yet it also zooms
	in on one particular relationship that threads throughout the larger-scale story.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/were-always-to-71076005">We're Always Looking Forward To Seeing You</a> by Alexandra Erin.
	A very creepy horror story of the AI-gone-wrong variety told entirely in hotel reviews.</li>
	<li><a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/richardson_08_22/">The Scene of the Crime</a> by Leonard Richardson.
	Grad students unionizing due to... temporally hazardous conditions.</li>
	<li><a href="https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/boden_08_22/">Migratory Patterns of the
Modern American Skyscraper</a> by Derrick Boden.
	If you're intrigued by the title, chances are you'll enjoy the story! This is a pretty short one, too.</li>
	<li><a href="http://strangehorizons.com/fiction/spirochete/">Spirochete</a> by Anneke Schwob.
	Excellent story about a haunted ankle.</li>
</ul>
